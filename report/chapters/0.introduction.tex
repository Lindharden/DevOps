\section{Introduction}

This report documents the refactoring and maintenance of the application named \textit{MiniTwit} which is made by the group named \textit{dudes} for the DevOps course at IT-University of Copenhagen. The project source is located on GitHub at \href{https://github.com/Lindharden/DevOps}{github.com/Lindharden/DevOps}, and the application is running at \href{http://157.230.76.157:8080}{157.230.76.157:8080}.

In section \ref{sec:system}, we describe the system and architecture of the MiniTwit application. Here we go through the dependencies of the application and how they interact with each other. In section \ref{sec:process}, we describe the process of maintaining MiniTwit with DevOps technologies. This includes the team organization, and the setups that we used in order to do DevOps. Finally, in section \ref{sec:lessons}, we describe the issues we ran into underway, and the main lessons we have learned.
