# Contribute to DevOps Minitwit

Welcome to the Minitwit DevOps project!

## Repository setup

It is a public repository with all members having collaborator status.

## Branching model

For this project we have decided on using feature branches.

## Distributed development workflow

The majority of the work will be done as mob programming.

## Contribution structure

As most work is done by mob programming most contributions are made by all repository members.

## Reviewing/integrating contributions

For contributions not done by mob programming, a random member is picked as reviewer and is responsible for merging.
