# Lecture 12: Infrastructure as Code
[Week 12](https://github.com/itu-devops/lecture_notes/blob/master/sessions/session_12/README_TASKS.md)

## Our use of infrastructure as Code
To implement infrastructure of code we utilize Vagrant, as we have already defined our infrastructure in the previous weeks.

Vagrant allows ease of use and versatility. Vagrant provides a simple yet powerful way to define and manage virtualized environments as code, allowing us to spin up reproducible, consistent, and scalable infrastructures for our project across different platforms, making it an ideal tool for our IoC implementation.

As we reflect on our decision to use Infrastructure as Code (IoC) in our DevOps project, we can see that it offers several key benefits. Firstly, it ensures consistent configurations and allows us to easily reproduce and rollback changes, improving reliability. Secondly, it enables scalability, flexibility, and agility by allowing us to easily modify and reuse code-based templates, making it adaptable to changing requirements. Additionally, IoC promotes collaboration, automation, and auditability, enhancing team efficiency and accountability. Overall, our decision to use IoC aligns with modern DevOps practices and brings numerous advantages to our project.
