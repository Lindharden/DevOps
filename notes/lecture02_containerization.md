## Step 1: Refactor ITU-MiniTwit to another language and technology of your choice

First of all we ran our test suite to see whether the tests pass or not. Here we have to tests that fail. To fix all of these tests, we had to change the string encoding. 

We decided to use the language GO for our refactoring. The first step here is to update our test suite to support our GO application.

We installed an Go SQL package on the system, and imported it into our application. This allows us to query the database using `sql.open()`.
